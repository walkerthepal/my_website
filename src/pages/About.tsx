          I began programming in college with C++ in a unix environment around 2016 at Florida State University. In 2019, after finishing my bachelors of science in Social Sciences with a primary focus in Environmental Science and a secondary in Urban Planning, I stayed curious about computer science. Enrolling in some community college (Polk State College) courses in Java and Python.

          In 2020, I accepted a role as a product manager for ModernCanna, an environmental testing and regulatory laboratory for the state of Florida. I identified the need for a technical solution to aid in the product manager workflow and wrote, 'Report Buddy', a desktop application to streamline reporting tasks. I also became interested in scripting as a solution for laborary tasks to replace tedious excel flows. I worked in depth with python, SQL, Crystal Reports, and WordPress during this time.

          I began working at Publix Super Market in 2022 as an Associate Software Engineer. By the end of 2023 was promoted to Software Engineer. I worked on large scale windows servers maintaining MySQL database clusters and associated infrastructure. This required developing scripting skills for PowerShell, C# MCP Protocol, Azure Policy and T-SQL.

          In late 2023, I decided to leave Publix to go back to school for my masters degree in computer science with a specialization in computing systems from Georgia Institute of Technology. I am currently looking for opportunities that align with this path.

          I have since worked on a handful of project to improve my skills across a wide range of technologies. For more information, see the projects section.
